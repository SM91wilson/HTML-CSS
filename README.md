# Homework
The project was to refactor the code of the website to make it more accessible and and to increase the SEO (search engine optimisation) of the website using semantic HTML tags.
I the changed the div tags to more semantic and useful tags. I added the header tag to designate the head of the page, the nav tag for the navigation links in the header, the main tag to inform the browser where the main content of the page is, the section tag to split up the different sections of content, the aside tag to put the content that is supplementary to the main content and the footer tag to designate the bottom of the webpage. This all increases the SEO of the webpage.
I also gave the webpage a more accurate title and fixed the first navigation link by changing the search optimisation class to an id.
I tidied up the code by spacing out elements and deleting redundant tags like the /img as it is a self closing tag.
alt attributes were missing from all from images so I added them which helps with the accessibility of the webpage.
I made changes in the CSS file to make it more coherent and efficient. I spaced out the elements and put them in an order more in line with the HTML, I altered the class, id and HTML tags to correspond with new classes and element tags I added to the HTML and I grouped classes that did the same thing into one new class to make it more efficient.
